## Compulsion Heroic/AOTC Team Standards  
_“We don't just pull bosses. We build victories.”_

### 🔥 Why Structure Matters  
Heroic isn't just Normal with bigger numbers. Every fight demands coordination, preparation, and accountability. One unenchanted weapon or missed interrupt can wipe the team.

### 🧠 Respect Everyone's Time  
Prepared = Empowered. Be ready with the approprate gear, gems, enchants, and consumables. Showing up ready means respecting the time and effort of your team.

### 🔄 Consistency = Progress  
Random rosters stall momentum. We iterate, improve, and assign roles based on a stable team. Progression thrives on consistency—not chaos.

### 🧩 Officer-Proof Systems  
Clear qualifications. No drama. Consistent participation, minimum ilvl, log improvements, and prep checklists make it easy to know who's ready. Officers shouldn't have to guess or debate - and neither should the players.

### 🏆 AOTC Is a Brand  
Compulsion stands for clarity, excellence, and pride. AOTC teams reflect our identity—branded visuals, clear expectations, and a shared sense of achievement.
