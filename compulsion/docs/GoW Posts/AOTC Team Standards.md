## 🛡️ Compulsion Heroic/AOTC Team Standards  
**“We don't just pull bosses. We build victories.”**  



### 🔥 Why Structure Matters  
Heroic isn't just Normal with bigger numbers.  
Every fight demands coordination, preparation, and accountability. One unenchanted weapon or missed interrupt can wipe the team.

### 🧠 Respect Everyone's Time  
Prepared = Empowered.  
Be ready with the appropriate gear, gems, enchants, and consumables. Showing up ready means respecting the time and effort of your team.

### 🔄 Consistency = Progress  
Random rosters stall momentum.  
We iterate, improve, and assign roles based on a stable team. Progression thrives on consistency—not chaos.

### 🧩 Officer-Proof Systems  
Clear qualifications. No drama.  
Consistent participation, minimum ilvl, log improvements, and prep checklists make it easy to know who's ready.  
Officers shouldn't have to guess or debate—and neither should the players.

### 🏆 AOTC Is a Brand  
Compulsion stands for clarity, excellence, and pride.  
AOTC teams reflect our identity—branded visuals, clear expectations, and a shared sense of achievement.
